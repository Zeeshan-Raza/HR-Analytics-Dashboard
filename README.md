# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
##Situation
Our organization was experiencing a noticeable increase in employee turnover, which was impacting productivity and increasing recruitment costs. Despite efforts to improve employee retention, the lack of data-driven insights made it difficult to identify the root causes of attrition. The HR department needed a comprehensive tool to analyze workforce data and derive actionable insights to address the attrition issue effectively.

##Task
As a data analyst, I was tasked with creating an HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to provide a detailed overview of various HR metrics. The goal was to help HR professionals and management visualize key data points, understand trends, and make informed decisions to improve employee retention and overall HR strategies.

##Action
Data Collection and Preparation:

Collected data from various HR systems, including employee demographics, performance records, salary details, and exit interviews.
Cleaned and prepared the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, including handling missing values and standardizing formats.
Dashboard Design and Development:

Designed the dashboard layout to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring it addressed the specific needs of HR professionals.
Created visualizations using Power BI, including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to represent key metrics such as attrition rates, average age and salary, attrition by education level, job role, age group, salary slab, years at the company, and gender.
Implemented interactive features, such as drill-down capabilities and filters, to allow users to explore the data in depth.
Key Metrics and Insights:

Attrition Metrics: Displayed total attrition, attrition rate, and segmented data by various dimensions.
Demographics: Showed average age, salary, and years at the company to understand the workforce composition.
Education Level: Analyzed attrition rates by different education levels to identify trends.
Age Group: Provided insights into which age groups were more likely to leave.
Job Role: Identified job roles with the highest attrition rates.
Salary Slab: Examined attrition trends based on salary brackets.

Gender: Highlighted gender-specific attrition trends.
Deployment and Training:

Deployed the dashboard on the organization's Power BI service for easy access by HR teams.
Conducted training sessions for HR professionals to ensure they could effectively use the dashboard to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.
##Result
Improved Insights: The dashboard provided HR professionals with clear and actionable insights into the causes of employee turnover.
Strategic Decision-Making: Enabled the HR team to implement targeted retention strategies based on data, such as addressing issues in specific job roles or salary slabs.
Reduced Attrition: Within six months of using the dashboard, the organization saw a 10% reduction in the attrition rate.
Cost Savings: The reduction in turnover led to significant savings in recruitment and training costs.
Enhanced Employee Engagement: By identifying and addressing key issues, the organization was able to improve overall employee satisfaction and engagement.
The HR Analytics Dashboard proved to be a valuable tool in transforming the organization's approach to managing human resources, leading to better retention rates and a more stable, satisfied workforce.
